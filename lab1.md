####c. Reading Reflection
#####The Open Source Definition
It's great to know that the definiton for Open Source is much more than just an access to the source code. It's particularly interesting to me to see criterias like "No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups" and "License Must be Technology-Neutral". To me that shows that the Open Source Initiative is open for everyone and anyone and is really is a collaborative commitment that allows a lot of creative freedom. This also will help me when I'm looking whether something is open source or not. I think I will now unconciously look for open source things whenever I'm on the web.

#####How to Ask Questions the Smart Way
Even though I don't really post questions on any forum, chat, or group, this is still a very relevant reading to me and my peers because when we are doing homework problems we usually go to the internet to seek answers. This reading warns against the way we can ask questions sometimes and it's interesting to me that the things that this reading says to 'not do', are all over the internet. When search for answers, I would usually end up reading a similar question asked by someone in a forum, chat, or group and a lot of times the questions can be rather ambiguous and they're a lot like the examples given in the reading. Another interesting thing that I came across in this reading was the different branches of Stack Exchange (Super User, Stack Overflow, Server Fault). Up until now, I didn't know that Stack Overflow was part of a bigger thing, Stack Exchange, and thought the two of them were somehow synonymous with each other. 

For answering questions in a helpful way, I think it's good to not assume that the person asking the question knows everything already. The answer should be explained as thoroughly and as destailed as possible. I also think it's to admit if you don't know an answer to a question and research about the question. Asking someone else who is more knowledgable is also helpful.

###g. Reflection
At this point, I don't really have a specific idea yet for what I want to do for the project. However, me and my friend was talking about making something like StackOverflow for the RPI community. This could be a community for RPI students to ask questions about subjects that they are taking. I was also interested in the idea of making a fun Google Chrome extension, maybe that allows you to play a game in the middle of work for stress relieve or maybe one that allows you to show your school schedule when you're on the internet. I will definitely start looking for things that might be interesting to create and talk about it with my friends more.
