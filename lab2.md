####2. Why is it important to choose a license?
It is important to choose a license because it lets other people know for sure if a program is open source or not.
Open-source is specifically defined and the license should make sure that the program is following all the conditions in order
for it to be open-source. Having a license also makes it clear to people for what they can and cannot do.

####3. Why they shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
They shouldn't use an explicit license because if it doesn't have a license, it is technically all rights reserved.
If a program is all rights reserved then no one can use the program, so there is a possibility that the user might get sued.

####4. Failure to follow the Open System Model
I agree with the claim because I think the idea of open-source is so that people in the community could contribute to 
the development of the program and Gopher was not 100% committed to the idea of that. They relied on themselves too much
and decided what the "right thing' was instead of asking the community for contributions. Gopher also did not allow the wider
community to critically review the development process because they only released the informational Request for Comments publication, 
but not the standards-track.

####5. Why a license is chosen (Linux)
Because Linux uses the GPL License, it allows the community to keep improving it until it becomes a success. Everyone who uses
Linux source code must also be governed under the GPL and cannot hold ownership to it. The GPL also allows Linux to be freely distributed so widely across computers and programs. 

####6. Pick a license for a project.
The project that we're picking a license for is our RCOS project SquareMeals. For this project, we're choosing the BSD License.
We chose this one because while it gives a lot of freedom for redistribution, it still requires that the authors will be credited.

####7. GPL, LGPL, Apache/BSD. Which one is better for a developer, a company, and the common good?

For the common good, I think Apache/BSD is better because it doesn't have a lot of restrictions and gives
freedom for a lot of people to do what they want while still giving credit to the original maker of the program.

For a developer, I think LGPL is good because it can allow other applications that don't have to be licensed
under GPL to use the program by the developer without much restriction.

For a company, I think GPL is better because it restritcs others who want to use
or modify the code to also have it licensed under GPL. But other people can still contribute to it to make it better
and they cannot hold ownership to it.

####10. Five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will the users and the license that will be chosen.
One example project would be an RPI grade calculator app. The users would be RPI students. The license that will be chosen is the
MIT License. We choose the MIT License because there are a lot of grade calculators out there so people can take the code
and do whatever they wish with it. The only thing unique about this app might be some features specifically for RPI.
